Planes can be accessed through the `Management area` section at the main menu.
Identifier, image, description and organization are the data that is listed in the table for each one.
A plane can be edited, deleted or created.
The list of planes can be sorted by column information (ascendant and descendant).

{% include image.html file="planes/planes/list.png" alt="Listing planes" %}

Through the edit option all those fields can be modified.
There are two sections to manage the zones related to the selected plane.
The first on a world map and the second on the image of the plane if it exists.
These sections are explained in depth in the `Adding zones to a plane` section.
