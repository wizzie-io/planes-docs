Planes can be accessed through the `Management area` section at the main menu. There are two sections to manage the zones related to the selected plane. The first on a world map and the second on the image of the plane if it exists.
Both sections offer the possibility of working with `full screen` to facilitate editing tasks.

## World map

Zones can be created, edited or deleted on the map using the right side editing options, with or without a plane image. `Rectangles`, `polygons`, or `lines` can be drawn. Clicking on each zone a menu appears in which the `name`, `color` and `dimensions` can be modified. It also offers the possibility of `erasure`.

If an image is imported, it can be adapted to the map using the `scaling`, `rotation`, `translation`, `scaling`, `locked`, and `opacity` options that appear under the zone editing options.

There is also a `geographical area finder` and the right click mouse option `Set plane here` to change the location of the plane image (if any) more easily.

## Image plane

This section appears when an image is imported into the form. This image must be correctly `geopositioned` on the map before proceeding to edit its zones using this section.

Zones can be `created`, `edited` or `deleted` on the image using the left side editing options. `Polygons` can be drawn. Clicking on each zone a menu appears in which the `name` can be modified. A `color` will be assigned automatically. It also offers the possibility of `erasure`.

On the right side there is a list of `Regions` and a `History`. Zones can be edited, deleted, locked, and hidden. The last changes can also be undone.

For the changes to take effect, they must be saved using the `Save` option in the same section.
